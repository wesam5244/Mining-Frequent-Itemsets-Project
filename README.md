# Mining-Frequent-Itemsets-Project
A scalability study of four algorithms for mining frequent itemsets 

This project focuses on comparing the performance of four algorithms for finding frequent itemsets: the A-Priori, PCY, Multistage, and Mutlihash algorithms. I implemented these algorithms, each of which has its own class, and performed the scalability study by dividing the itemset into different chunks and running each algorithm on each chunk for the following support thresholds: 1%, 5%, and 10%. The results of the performance time were then placed on a line graph to be compared
